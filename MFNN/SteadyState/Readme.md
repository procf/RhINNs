## Multi-fidelity neural networks for steady shear rheometric prediction

We've prepared and commented our Jupyter notebooks to ensure a smooth experience exploring our models and analyses. Should you have any inquiries or wish to discuss our work further, don't hesitate to reach out at [saadat.m@northeastern.edu](mailto:saadat.m@northeastern.edu). 

**Note for Offline Use:** If you're planning to run the notebooks offline or locally, please ensure you adjust the paths to the Excel files accordingly. Look for the lines in the notebooks that load these files – they are clearly commented for easy identification and modification. This small adjustment will allow you to seamlessly transition between online (Colab) and offline environments.
