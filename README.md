# general-template
This is a general template for a project repository

## Repository admin

Most repositories will be Private at first (**always** check with Safa before making a repository public)

A repository should **always** include:
- A .gitignore file to prevent unnecessary files from being backed up <br>
  *the .gitignore included here prevents common unnecessary files from hoomd-blue <3.2, C++, Python, R, Julia, macOS, Office365, and LaTeX/TeX from being backed up to the repository; if you need additional templates you can find them at [https://github.com/github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)*
- A README.md file with a description of the repository and its contents, as well as the name of the contact person for this project (usually you, the creator)

When making a Public repository you will often want to add a LICENSE file. Discuss with Safa about what type of license to use (for example, many open source projects use the simple MIT License, while HOOMD-blue is released under a BSD 3-Clause License).<br>
You can add a license at any time. See github's [instructions on how to add a LICENSE to an existing repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository).

## What to include in your repository

Github repositories should only include code files, documentation, and small data files (recommended <50MB, max 2GB). If your code uses large data files and is being made public it is recommended you include a small sample data set.
