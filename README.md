# Rheology-informed neural networks
In this repo, I'll post our projects in rheology-informed neural networks (RhINNs).

# Who we are
We are a computational [lab](https://web.northeastern.edu/complexfluids/research/) at Northeastern University, Boston, MA (PI Professor [Safa Jamali](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/jamali-safa/)). We are mostly interested in physics and rheology of matters. At the moment, our group has three main cores:
1. Hemorheology of blood using Dissipative Particle Dyanmics (DPD),
2. Colloid dynamics using DPD, and
3. Physics-informed learning in rheology.

This repo is created [and hopefully remains updated] for the third concentration of our group. I am Milad Saadat. Feel free to reach out to me if you had questions/comments about this repo.

# Contributors and authors

For each project, you can find the contributing authors in the corresponding folders.
